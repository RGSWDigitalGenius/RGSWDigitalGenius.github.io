                <p>
                    Digital Genius is a group of students ranging from years 7 all the way up to sixth form, whilst being joined by the teachers. We're around on Open Days showing parents how we use the Digital Learning Program (DLP) to enhance learning across the whole school.
                    <br><br>
                    We're currently working on many projects, one being the Tech Museum which can be located <a href="../pages/techmuseum.html" style="color: white; font-style: normal;" >here</a>. You probably found this website through the QR codes in the Tech Museum anyway.
                    <br>
                    As of now, it's not fully completed but is planned to be finished in due course.
                    <br><br>
                    We hope to see you around on Open Day!
                </p>
