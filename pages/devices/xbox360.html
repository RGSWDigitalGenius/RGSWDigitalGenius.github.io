            <p>The Xbox 360 is a video game console part of the Xbox series brand developed by Microsoft.
            <br>
            This was a successor to the original Xbox, which is also in our tech museum! If you havenâ€™t seen it on our page, check it out <a href="https://digitalgenius.org.uk/pages/devices/xboxoriginal.html">here</a>.

            The PlayStation 3 developed by Sony, and Nintendoâ€™s Wii were the obvious competitors with the Xbox 360. This second console in the Xbox series featured an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous version on the original Xbox. Xbox live received regular updates like any service during the consoleâ€™s lifetime. This service allowed players to play online games, download games through the Xbox Live Arcade, and download game demos to try out games that they may like to purchase at some time. It also enabled them to easily purchase and stream music directly from their Xbox console, play television programs and much more.
            <br>
            Numerous peripheral devices have been released to be compatible with the Xbox 360, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage to store more games, and the different types of files for the services Xbox Live can provide as explained above, and the Kinect motion sensing camera.
            <br>
            The Xbox 360 was released around 2005 and its lifespan went to about 2016, which is a pretty good amount of time for a console to last for! Of course, itâ€™s operating system was a custom one, the Xbox 360 System Software OS, and the machine using a 3.2 GHz PowerPC Tri-Core Xenon CPU and using 512 MB of unified GDDR3 RAM clocked at 700 MHz. Note that there was also 10MB of eDRAM (embedded DRAM, integrated on the same multi-chip module (MCM), which allows for much higher operation speeds) cache on the Xenos GPU.
