            <p>This device can be seen with various other game boxes for the PS2 in the tech museum.
            <br>
            It was developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The first release of the product was based in Japan, on the 4th March 2000, and in North America on the 26th October 2000, amongst many other places.
            <br>
            Obviously the PlayStation 2 is the successor to the original PlayStation, and was the second installment in the PlayStation brand of game consoles. This product faced many challenges, competitive wise.. due to it being in a sixth-generation console, it had so many competitors such as Nintendo's GameCube, Sega's Dreamcast, and Microsoft's Xbox lineup.
            <br>
            Being the best-selling video game console of all time, in total it had sold over 155 million units worldwide, completely thrashing the numbers of the Dreamcast, Xbox and Gamecube all in one go.
            <br><br>
            Broadcasted by Sony worldwide in 1999, they announced they would be continuing the PlayStation series lineup, and creating the second product in the series.. the PlayStation 2. Because of all the excitement, over 4,000 games were developed for the device.
            <br>
            Sony decided they needed a more slim, lighter PlayStation so, based of the PS2 design, they created the PS2 Slim. Because everybody liked the PS2 Slim so much, it carried it's popularity pretty far into the seventh generation, even after the PlayStation 3 was released.
            <br>
            After over twelve whole years, production stopped for the PlayStation 2 in 2013. Remember, this was one of the longest ever lifespans for any video game console. Games continued to be developed and released way after the product's production and support had been discontinued.
            <br><br>
            This just goes to show how much the gaming community appreciated this phenominal device.</p>
