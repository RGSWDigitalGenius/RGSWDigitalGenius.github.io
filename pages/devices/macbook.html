          <p>Released in May 2007, the MacBook (mid-2007) wasn't a major revamp, but rather a refresh of the late 2006 model. Think of it as the iPhone 13 to the 12: mostly the same, but with a few key improvements.
          <br><br>
          The biggest change was the processor. Apple swapped the Core Duo in the earlier model for a zippier Intel Core 2 Duo. This meant faster performance for everyday tasks like browsing the web, writing documents, and even editing photos. Imagine going from a car with a four-cylinder engine to one with a six-cylinder â€“â€“ things just felt smoother and quicker.
          <br>
          Other upgrades included a slightly larger hard drive (up to 160GB) and improved Wi-Fi support with the new 802.11n standard. This meant faster internet speeds, especially if you had a compatible router at home. Plus, the keyboard received a tweak, gaining multimedia control keys like play, pause, and volume. Overall, the MacBook (mid-2007) was a solid update, offering better performance and usability without reinventing the wheel.
          <br><br>
          However, it's important to remember that this is a 17-year-old laptop by now. While it can still handle basic tasks, it won't be able to run the latest software or perform resource-intensive activities like video editing.</p>
