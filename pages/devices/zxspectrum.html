            <p>The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit home computer. It's main design was focused around being small, portable, simple and have a low overall cost. It was conceived and designed by English entrepreneur and inventor Clive Sinclair, who was well known for his eccentricity and pioneering.
            <br>
            The design came from the name "Spectrum", as the colour spectrum, as you can see the rainbow on the right side of the device.
            <br>
            During the release, it was first shipped out via mail, but then after the issue of severe backlogs, the machine was sold through High Street chains in the United Kingdom.
            <br><br>
            Sadly, this device was discontinued in 1992, but still sold a whopping 5 million models!</p>
